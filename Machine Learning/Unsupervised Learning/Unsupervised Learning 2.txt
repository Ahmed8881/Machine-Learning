ou saw what is unsupervised learning, and one type of unsupervised learning called clustering. Let's give a slightly more formal definition of unsupervised learning and take a quick look at some other types of unsupervised learning other than clustering. Whereas in supervised learning, the data comes with both inputs x and input labels y, in unsupervised learning, the data comes only with inputs x but not output labels y, and the algorithm has to find some structure or some pattern or something interesting in the data. We're seeing just one example of unsupervised learning called a clustering algorithm, which groups similar data points together. In this specialization, you'll learn about clustering as well as two other types of unsupervised learning. One is called anomaly detection, which is used to detect unusual events. This turns out to be really important for fraud detection in the financial system, where unusual events, unusual transactions could be signs of fraud and for many other applications. You also learn about dimensionality reduction. This lets you take a big data-set and almost magically compress it to a much smaller data-set while losing as little information as possible. In case anomaly detection and dimensionality reduction don't seem to make too much sense to you yet. Don't worry about it. We'll get to this later in the specialization. Now, I'd like to ask you another question to help you check your understanding, and no pressure, if you don't get it right on the first try, is totally fine. Please select any of the following that you think are examples of unsupervised learning. Two are unsupervised examples and two are supervised learning examples. Please take a look.
