#Plotting the data You can plot these two points using the scatter() function in the matplotlib library, as shown in the cell below.The function arguments marker and c show the points as red crosses (the default is blue dots).You can use other functions in the matplotlib library to set the title and labels to display
#plot the data points
plt.scatter(x_train,y_train,marker='x',c='r')
#set the title
plt.title('House Prices')
# set the y label
plt.ylabel('Price in 1000s of dollars')
# set the x label
plt.xlabel('Size in 1000s of square feet')
#display the plot
plt.show()
