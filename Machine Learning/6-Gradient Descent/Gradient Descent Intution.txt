Notes on Gradient Descent: Understanding the Learning Rate and Derivative:


Gradient Descent Algorithm:
1-The learning rate (𝛼) controls the step size for updating parameters 
w and b.
2-The term 𝑑𝑤/du represents the derivative (or partial derivative) of the cost function J with respect to 𝑤.

Learning Rate (𝛼):
1-A small positive number, typically between 0 and 1.
2-Determines how big or small the steps are in the descent process.
Large α: aggressive, large steps.
Small α: conservative, small steps.

Derivative Term:

1-The derivative of J at a point indicates the slope of the tangent line to the curve at that point.
2-Positive derivative: slope is positive, indicating the curve is rising.
3-Negative derivative: slope is negative, indicating the curve is falling.

Example with One Parameter (w):

Consider a cost function 𝐽(𝑤)with w as a single parameter.
