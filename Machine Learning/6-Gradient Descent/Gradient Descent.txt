Notes on Gradient Descent Algorithm
Objective:

Minimize the cost function 
J(w,b).

General Application:

Gradient descent can minimize any function, not just the cost function for linear regression.
Can be applied to models with multiple parameters (w1, w2, w3, ..., wn).


Algorithm Overview:
1-Initialization
Start with initial guesses for w and ùëè
often set to 0

2-Iterative Process:
Iteratively adjust w and ùëè to reduce the cost 
J(w,b) Continue until  J reaches or nears a minimum.

Conceptual Understanding:

Surface Plot Example:
Imagine a hilly surface representing the cost function.
High points are hills, low points are valleys.
Starting at a point, you want to move to the lowest valley.
Gradient Descent Steps:

Choose Direction:
Look around and determine the direction of steepest descent (downhill).
Take Step:
Take a small step in that direction.
Repeat this process from the new position.
Reach Minimum:
Continue taking steps until you reach a local minimum.
Properties of Gradient Descent:

Local Minima:
Different starting points can lead to different local minima.
Starting at different points on the surface can lead to settling in different valleys.
Mathematical Implementation:

The next step will involve looking at the mathematical expressions to implement gradient descent effectively.
Note:

Gradient descent is foundational for training advanced models, including neural networks (deep learning).
Understanding and applying gradient descent is crucial for minimizing cost functions in various machine learning models.
