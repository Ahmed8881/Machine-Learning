Learning Rate (Alpha) and Gradient Descent:••••

1-Effect of Small Learning Rate (Alpha):

•If alpha is too small, gradient descent takes tiny steps towards the minimum.

•This results in very slow convergence because each update moves W by a minuscule amount.

•While gradient descent will eventually converge to the minimum, it does so very slowly, requiring many iterations.

2-Effect of Large Learning Rate (Alpha):

• Conversely, if alpha is too large, gradient descent takes large steps.

• This can lead to overshooting the minimum point of the cost function.

• Subsequent updates may continue to overshoot, causing the algorithm to diverge rather than converge.

• In extreme cases, this can prevent convergence altogether.

3-Behavior at Local Minimum:

• If the current parameter W is at a local minimum, the derivative of the cost function with respect to W is zero at that point.
• Gradient descent update rule then dictates that W remains unchanged (W = W - alpha * 0).
• Thus, if W is already at a local minimum, further iterations of gradient descent do not alter W, which is desirable as it keeps the solution stable at the minimum.

4-Automatic Adjustment of Step Size:

• During gradient descent, as W approaches a local minimum, the derivative (slope) of the cost function decreases.
• Consequently, the step size automatically reduces because each update is proportional to the derivative multiplied by alpha.
• This adaptive behavior helps gradient descent to naturally converge towards a minimum, even if alpha is kept constant.
