Notes on Gradient Descent Algorithm Implementation

Equation Overview:
The equal sign (=) is the assignment operator in programming. It assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left. For example, in the equation y = 2x + 3, the value of y is assigned the result of 2x + 3.

Example: a = c assigns the value of c to the variable a.
Example: a = a + 1 increments the value of a by 1.
In programming, = is different from the equality assertion in mathematics (==). The equality assertion checks if two values are equal.

Learning Rate (α):
1-The Greek letter α (alpha) represents the learning rate.
2-The learning rate is a small positive number (e.g., 0.01).
3-Controls the step size in gradient descent:
4-Large α: large steps downhill.
5-Small α: small, careful steps.

Derivative Term:
1-Represents the direction of the steepest descent.
2-Combined with α, it determines the step size.
3-Originates from calculus, but detailed knowledge of calculus is not necessary.
