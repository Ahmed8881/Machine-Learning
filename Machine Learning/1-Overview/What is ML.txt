Machine learning is a technology that we use in our daily lives without even realizing it.
Examples of machine learning include search engines ranking web pages, social media apps recognizing and labeling friends in pictures, and streaming services recommending similar movies.
Voice-to-text on phones and email spam filters are also applications of machine learning.
Machine learning is not limited to consumer applications; it is also being used in big companies and industrial settings.
Examples include optimizing wind turbine power generation, assisting doctors in making accurate diagnoses, and using computer vision in factories for quality inspection.
Machine learning is the science of teaching computers to learn without explicit programming.
